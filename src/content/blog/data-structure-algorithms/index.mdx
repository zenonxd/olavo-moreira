This is the initial post where I'm going to publish my studies regarding Data Structure and Algorithms.

Here, you will be able to understand the basics, seeing examples of the most common algorithms in computational science.

We are also going to learn how to apply these algorithms and data structure in real exercises (like Leet Code). Those
exercises most likely can be charged in job interviews.

If you are interested to keep up with these studies, you have to know at least one programming language (Java, Python, Go,
and others).

And yeah, also, object-oriented programming and the basics: how to manipulate strings, arrays, etc.

**Disclaimer:** all the content used to make this studies was thanks to Augusto Galego, check him on X, [@RealGalego](https://x.com/RealGalego).

Below, we have the list of all the topics that we are going to approach. The ideia is to follow the order, but if you are
looking for some specific stuff, feel free to check it out.


## First Section - Data Structure (Basics)

We are going to begin with the data structure itself, how to organize, storage and manipulate data in memory, making it
easy to do efficient operations and algorithms.

Vamos começar pela estrutura de dado, ou seja, como organizamos, armazenamos e manipulamos dados na memória, facilitando operações eficientes.

- Big O Notation
- Introduction to Arrays
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Queues
- Hash map
- Resume of the Most Important Data Structures
- Stack
- Binary Trees
- Graphs
- Trie
- B-Tree
